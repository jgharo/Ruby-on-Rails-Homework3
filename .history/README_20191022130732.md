* NOTE: The project is hosted on Heroku and may take a moment to start up.

* Explore the application to understand what it does. You can add records and experiment.
Any records you add will be visible to others in the class, so do not enter crude names, etc.

* The assignment is to recreate the application on your own.
You will need to create nested forms, as you will see. You may use the cocoon gem that we used in class,
or any other method you find online to implement nested forms.

* To turn in the assignment, you will need to create a project on Github and push your code to it,
and then upload a zip file of the entire project here.

* This is a graded assignment. You can and should  discuss the assignment with others,
however the code WILL be checked for copying and appropriate action taken if there is evidence
of you not doing your own work.
